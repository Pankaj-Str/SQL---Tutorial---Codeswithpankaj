## **3. Querying into Data (DQL)**

   **3.1 SELECT Statement**
   - Introduction to Data Query Language (DQL).
   - Basic syntax of the `SELECT` statement.
   - Querying data from a single table.
   - Practical example: Retrieving all records from the Employee table.

   **3.2 WHERE Clause**
   - Filtering data using the `WHERE` clause.
   - Applying conditions with different operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical).
   - Combining conditions with AND, OR, and NOT operators.
   - Practical example: Querying employees with a salary greater than a certain amount.

   **3.3 Operators in SQL**
   - **Arithmetic Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
     - Using arithmetic operators in SQL queries.
     - Practical example: Calculating total salaries.
   - **Comparison Operators:** `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
     - Using comparison operators in the `WHERE` clause.
     - Practical example: Finding employees hired after a specific date.
   - **Logical Operators:** `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
     - Combining conditions with logical operators.
     - Practical example: Querying employees with specific job titles or departments.
